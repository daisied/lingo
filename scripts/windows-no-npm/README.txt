# Lingo prebuilt (Windows, no npm)

1. Fully close Discord (including tray/background process).
2. Double-click `install-stable.bat`.
3. If multiple installs are found (Discord/PTB/Canary), pick the one you want.
4. Open Discord.

Notes:
- This installs the prebuilt custom Vencord bundle from this folder.
- Do NOT run `VencordInstallerCli.exe` directly; use the `.bat` scripts so Lingo is included.
- If Discord updates and Lingo disappears, run `install-stable.bat` again.
- To remove this build, run `uninstall-stable.bat`.
